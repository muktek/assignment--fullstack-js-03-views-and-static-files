# Full Stack JS Project
**`fullstack-js-02-server-router`**


## Context
You are going to build a full stack web application with node.js + React. In order to become familiar with how a node project works, you will be responsible for configuring the  initial major components of the project.  

- express server
- **application routes [this assignment]**
- views
- api layer
  - data access
  - data models (ORM)
  - RESTful routes


## The Assignment
For this assignment, we will focus on creating the **express router** and the **express views**.

#### Overview

- Configure the express router to serve the following routes:
  ```
  /                  : '<h1>HOME page</h1>'
  /about             : '<h1>ABOUT Page</h1>'
  /api/jobs          : json - jobsData
  /api/companies     : json - companies

  * No Match *       : '<h1>404 - Page Not Found!</h1>'
  ```

- Serve the `404.html` page when there is no match

#### Requirements

- you must create a `routers/` directory in `src/`

- you must create 2 router files in the `routers/` directory:
  - `pageRouter.js`
  - `apiRouter.js`

- you must initialize the `express.Router()` in the 2 router files, export the routers in `module.exports`
  - for `pageRouter.js`
    - `/` route should send the simple string `<h1>HOME page</h1>`
    - `/about` route should send the `<h1>ABOUT page</h1>`
  - for `apiRouter.js`
    - `/api/jobs` route should send _`jobsData`_
    - `/api/companies` route should send _`companiesData`_ (see below)

- the routes must be imported in `server.js` and passed correctly to `app.use(....)`


  ```js
  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
  ```


## Setup Instructions

In Terminal:

```sh
# (1) navigate to your project--devjobs directory
cd ~/Documents/muktek/assignments/project--devjobs

# (2) Commit your changes from the previous demo
git commit -m 'committing work from part-01'

# (3) You will work on the part-02-router branch for this feature
git checkout -b part-02-router


```
